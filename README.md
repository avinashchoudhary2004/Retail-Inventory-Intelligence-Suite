## **Project Overview**
UrbanRetail Co., a high-velocity retail chain, is experiencing significant profit leakage due to a disconnect between logistics data and operational decision-making. Despite possessing rich sales and supply chain datasets, the lack of integrated predictive intelligence has created an "Inventory Paradox": simultaneous stockouts on high-margin items and capital trapped in dead stock. This forces store managers to rely on gut feeling rather than data, leading to reactive firefighting instead of proactive optimization.

### Key Problem Statements

* **Revenue Leakage:** frequent stockouts

* **Inflated Holding Costs:** Systemic overstocking is driving up storage costs and trapping working capital in slow-moving inventory.

* **Inventory Opacity:** Poor SKU visibility across the store network hinders effective stock transfers and balancing.

* **Reactive Operations:** Decision-making is retrospective rather than predictive, forcing managers to "firefight" issues after they occur.

* **Data Underutilization:** Rich sales and logistics datasets remain siloed and descriptive, failing to drive algorithmic optimization.

## Meet the Team
- **Avinash Choudhary** - **Lead Product Analyst & Engineer**: Owned the end-to-end product lifecycle. Translated business pain points into technical requirements, designed the database architecture, defined strategic risk KPIs, and built the decision-support dashboard.
- **Abhishek Choudhary** - **Machine Learning Engineer** Developed and tuned the XGBoost forecasting model to detect demand bias and quantify prediction risk ......


## Solution Overview
This project builds an end-to-end *Prescriptive Inventory Decision Engine*, starting with a Python-based *ELT pipeline* that transforms raw OLTP transaction logs into a high-performance *Star Schema data warehouse (PostgreSQL)*. *Business-critical KPIs* such as Projected Stockout Loss, Critical Coverage Ratio, and Forecast WAPE are computed using SQL-based *OLAP views*. An external XGBoost forecast bias classifier is integrated to contextualize demand signals and flag unreliable predictions. 

All analytical intelligence is consolidated into an Action-First Dashboard for store managers, converting complex backend logic into immediate, actionable decisions that enable proactive management of overstock and stockout risk, low-inventory alerts, forecast reliability, and real-time inventory recommendations.

## Features
- **Automated ELT Pipeline:** Orchestrates the extraction, loading, and transformation of raw logs into a normalized Star Schema warehouse.
- **Modular Data Architecture:** Organized into clear layers (Raw $\to$ DWH $\to$ Reporting) with robust configuration management and execution logging.
- **Business-Centric KPIs:** Defined key KPIs, each mapped to business problems like Projected Stockout Loss and Forecast Reliability Score.
- **ML-Driven Forecast Audit:** Integrates an XGBoost classifier to detect forecast bias (Over/Under-estimation), flagging unreliable predictions before they impact ordering. ......
- **Action-First Dashboard:**  Prescriptive, action-first dashboard enabling store managers to proactively manage stockouts, overstock, and replenishment.


## Technical Execution & Decision Flow

This project was designed as an **end-to-end decision intelligence system**, converting raw inventory and forecast data into actionable business recommendations.

### Step 1: Data Architecture (Star Schema)

A scalable **3-layer PostgreSQL architecture** was designed to clearly separate ingestion, storage, and analytics, ensuring both performance and maintainability.

#### **Architecture Layers:**

1. **Raw Layer (`raw`)**
   - Landing zone for unprocessed inventory snapshots and raw 7-day demand forecasts. Mirrors OLTP-style ERP data with no transformations applied.

2. **Data Warehouse Layer (`dwh`)**
   - Normalized **Star Schema** optimized for historical analysis and KPI computation.
   - **Dimensions** - `dim_product`, `dim_store` ,`dim_date`
   - **Fact Table**    - `fct_daily_inventory` (inventory position, sales, forecast, pricing)

- **Reporting Layer (`rpt`)**
  - Pre-aggregated **OLAP views** containing business logic. Acts as the single source of truth for dashboards and downstream analytics.
  - Examples - `inventory_health`, `forecast_deviation`
---

### Step 2: ELT Pipeline Orchestration

A Python-based orchestration layer (`main.py`) simulates a **production-grade ELT workflow**, ensuring repeatability and automation.

**Pipeline Flow:**

1. **Simulation (OLTP Emulation)**
   - `data_generator.py` generates synthetic daily transaction logs.
   - Mimics real-time ERP inventory and sales feeds.

2. **Extraction & Loading**
   - Raw CSV logs are ingested directly into the PostgreSQL `raw` schema.

3. **Transformation**
     - Clean and standardize raw data
     - Append historical records to the DWH
     - Refresh reporting-layer OLAP views

This design ensures that **dashboards always reflect the latest operational state**.

---

### Step 3: Strategic KPI Definition

To bridge the gap between **data visibility** and **decision-making**, five strategic KPIs were defined. Each KPI is mapped to a **specific business problem** and clears represent the **present and future risks** helping store managers to make better business decisions for inventory management.

| **Projected Stockout Loss (Next 24h)**     | Immediate revenue lost if SKUs stock out before replenishment    | Revenue at risk from predicted inventory shortfall in next 24 hours                        | $\small \max(\text{Next Day forecast} - \text{On Hand Inventory},0)\times\text{Unit Price}$                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Prioritize emergency replenishment by **revenue impact**; expedite on-order deliveries.                       |
| **Low Inventory SKUs (DoS < 2)**           | Service-level risk for SKUs likely to stock out within lead time | % of SKUs with inventory coverage below a 2-day safety threshold                           | $\small DoS = \text{Full Days Covered} + \dfrac{\text{Remaining Inventory}}{\text{Demand of Next Partial Day}}$                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Increase on-order quantities for SKUs with DoS < 2.                                                           |
| **Capital Locked in Overstock (DoS > 4)**  | Working capital tied in excess inventory, raising holding cost   | Monetary value of inventory beyond a 4-day efficient supply cap                            | $\small (\text{Total Inventory} - \text{Total 4 days demand}) \times \text{Unit Price}$                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Target SKUs for markdowns, promotions, or redistribution.                                                     |
| **Inventory Velocity (Avg Life on Shelf)** | Slow movers create dead stock and clutter shelf space            | Avg days an SKU sits in inventory before sale                                              | $\displaystyle \text{Turnover}=\frac{\sum_i(\text{Turnover}*i\times\text{UnitsSold}*{i,30})}{\sum_i\text{UnitsSold}_{i,30}}$<br><br>$\displaystyle \text{Avg Life on Shelf}=\frac{30}{\text{Turnover}}$                                                                                                                                  | Fast movers → expand shelf space & shorten reorder cycles.<br>Slow movers → clearance, delist, or reallocate. |
| **Forecast Reliability Score (WAPE)**      | Low trust in forecasts causes manual overrides and stock risk    | Volume-weighted forecast error emphasizing high-selling SKUs and error direction/frequency | $\small\text{Portfolio KPI}=\dfrac{\sum (\text{WAPE}_i\times\text{UnitsSold}*i)}{\sum \text{UnitsSold}*i}$<br><br>$\small\text{WAPE}*{\text{over}}=\dfrac{\sum*{F_t>A_t}(\text{WAPE}_i\times\text{UnitsSold}*i)}{\sum*{F_t>A_t}\text{UnitsSold}*i}$<br><br>$\displaystyle \text{Freq}*{\text{over}}=\dfrac{\sum \mathbf{1}(F_t>A_t)}{N}$ | Adjust safety stock by measured risk; monitor over/under frequencies; fix model issues promptly.              |

**Outcome:**  
These KPIs convert raw forecasts and inventory positions into **prioritized actions**, enabling faster decisions with measurable financial impact.

### Step 4: ML Model
An XGBoost-based forecast bias classifier is integrated to enhance demand signal accuracy. The model, trained in `ML model/model.zz/train.py`, analyzes historical forecast deviations to predict bias (over-forecast vs. under-forecast). Outputs are stored in `predictions_output.csv` and ingested into the pipeline for KPI contextualization. Performance is audited via `Forecast Deviation.csv`, ensuring reliable predictions and reducing manual overrides.

### Step 5: Action-First Dashboard

**Purpose:**

- An Action-First Inventory Intelligence dashboard that turns warehouse-grade analytics and model outputs into immediate, operational decisions—reducing stockouts, trimming holding costs, and improving SKU visibility across stores.

**Target Audience:**

- Store Managers (Execution): Need instant, daily "Reorder" vs. "Hold" signals to manage fast-moving stock.
- Supply Chain Analysts (Oversight): Need to monitor network-wide financial risk (Stockout Loss) and model performance.

**Key Capabilities & Features:**

- **Operational Alerts & Triage:** Automatic flagging of inventory status for each SKUs, including potential Stockouts, Overstock, and Critical Coverage (DoS < 2 Days).
- **Prescriptive Decision Engine:** Removes guesswork by mapping analytical status directly to business recommandations.
- **Holistic Inventory Visibility:** Provides a complete financial and operational snapshot, tracking Total Inventory, category-wise breakdowns, On-Hand vs. On-Order positions, and Working Capital trends over time to monitor liquidity.
- **Forecast Reliability Audit:** A transparency module designed to build trust in the model. It tracks WAPE (Forecast Deviation), analyzes the Frequency of Error Direction (Over-forecast vs. Under-forecast), and measures the magnitude of Error in each direction to determine the impact of the error.
- **Turnover Velocity Heatmap:** Solves "Poor SKU Visibility" by visualizing turnover rates for every product at every store ID. This instantly segregates "Fast Movers" from "Slow Movers" to optimize shelf assortment.
- **Multi-Dimensional Drilldown:** Enables a high-speed investigative workflow with a navigation path from Portfolio $\rightarrow$ Store $\rightarrow$ SKU. Dynamic filters for Date Range, Category, and Product allow users to isolate specific KPI health issues in seconds.

**Business Impact:**

- **Reduces Firefighting:** Shifts the store team from "reacting to empty shelves" to "predicting replenishment needs."
- **Secures Revenue:** Proactively closes the supply gap to prevent lost sales on high-margin items.
- **Capital Efficiency:** Identifies overstock immediately, allowing for faster markdowns to free up working capital.
